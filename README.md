# slackboard
#### Created by the P5 Slackbots -  Kevin Do, Abhijay Deevi, and Kian Kishimoto
project still in beta development

#### Description:
This interactive soundboard allows users to produce their own beats with our sounds or even with their own 
sounds. Users can create their own soundboards or find custom-made soundboards on our public library. 
Users will also be able to record and upload their recordings to our public gallery so other users can see 
their creations.

There will be multiple sound boards that you can use that are insane. It ranges from the nature filled
animal noises to the materialistic smacking noises. 

All of these soundboards will be COMPLETELY interactive as you can press the buttons to hear the sound or even
press a key on your keyboard to make the sound come up. 

#### Resources
For each sound on the sound boards, we will pull data from public sound libraries online, for example https://freesound.org/, https://www.epidemicsound.com/sound-effects/, and https://www.zapsplat.com/. Each sound file has its own url which we'll be able to utilize to link to each button for the soundboard. However, for some of the soundboards we'll make custom sounds by recording and uploading files to use locally.
