# slackboard
#### Created by the P5 Slackbots -  Kevin Do, Abhijay Deevi, and Kian Kishimoto
project still in beta development


### Description:
slackboard is a sleek and clean online soundboard which allows you to create that sick beat you've been dreaming about.
This interactive soundboard allows users to produce their own beats with our sounds or even with their own 
sounds. Users can create their own soundboards or find custom-made soundboards on our public library, compiled by users from all around the globe. 
Users will also be able to record and upload their recordings to our public gallery so other users can see their masterpieces.

These soundboards aren't the typical click on the screen to make a noise, but they are interactive. From button animations and being able to play sounds with the click of the key, you will be able to produce your own custom beats at ease.


### Resources
For each sound on the sound boards, we will pull data from public sound libraries online, for example https://freesound.org/, https://www.epidemicsound.com/sound-effects/, and https://www.zapsplat.com/. Each sound file has its own url which we'll be able to utilize to link to each button for the soundboard. However, for some of the soundboards we'll make custom sounds by recording and uploading files to use locally. 

### Delivery Plans/Objectives:  
Midterm: First Fully Functionable Soundboard 
- The soundboard will be able to be clicked and be able to play sounds. The soundboard will have clicking animations and users will be able to use their keyboard to click the onscreen buttons.

N@TM: Multiple Soundboards
- We will have multiple themed soundboards for the user to use such as electronic, acoustic drums, etc. Users will be able to record themselves playing the soundboard and play it to hear again.

Collegeboard: Final Touch Ups and 0 Bugs
- Users will be able to upload their recordings to our public library for others to play and listen to it. The library will store their songs and also store their username so listeners can know who the producer of the song is.


### Database Implementation
Users
- names of users that upload to public library

Soundboards/Sounds
- custom soundboards made by people which can be shared on a public library
- our default soundboards and their sounds

Recordings
- recordings can be created and shared to the public library
