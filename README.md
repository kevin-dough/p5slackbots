#### Created by the P5 Slackbots -  Kevin Do, Abhijay Deevi, and Kian Kishimoto
project still in beta development


#### Description:
slackboard is a sleek and clean online soundboard which allows you to create that sick beat you've been dreaming about.
This interactive soundboard allows users to produce their own beats with our sounds or even with their own 
sounds. Users can create their own soundboards or find custom-made soundboards on our public library, compiled by users from all around the globe. 
Users will also be able to record and upload their recordings to our public gallery so other users can see their masterpieces.

These soundboards aren't the typical click on the screen to make a noise, but they are interactive. From button animations and being able to play sounds with the click of the key, you will be able to produce your own custom beats at ease.


#### Resources
For each sound on the sound boards, we will pull data from public sound libraries online, for example https://freesound.org/, https://www.epidemicsound.com/sound-effects/, and https://www.zapsplat.com/. Each sound file has its own url which we'll be able to utilize to link to each button for the soundboard. However, for some of the soundboards we'll make custom sounds by recording and uploading files to use locally. 

#### Database Implementation
Users
- names of users that upload to public library

Soundboards/Sounds
- custom soundboards made by people which can be shared on a public library
- our default soundboards and their sounds

Recordings
- recordings can be created and shared to the public library
